Hello!
These are our python notebooks that were used in our project.
- Streamlit_good is the notebook for the "liked" interface.
- Streamlit_bad is the notebook for the "unliked" interface.
- Interface&Intellegence is the notebook for processing the results.

We recommend you use Google Colab (or any other jupyter notebook app) to run the notebooks :)
